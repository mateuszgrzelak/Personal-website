        <div class="about_me">I am a automatic control and robotics engineer who's knowledgeable
            in both computer science and electrical engineering. I decided to
            change career path and become a programmer, because
            programming gives me the greatest satisfaction. Below you can see some of rules that I follow:

                        time and nerves. I try to use TDD as often as possible.
